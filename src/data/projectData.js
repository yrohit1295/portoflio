            'Implemented market basket analysis using the Apriori algorithm on a grocery dataset. Used Hadoop HDFS for distributed file storage and MRJob for MapReduce execution. Performed data cleaning via MapReduce to improve computation time. Found that increasing support confidence and iteration count improved performance. Explored Apriori algorithm trade-offs such as memory usage and scalability.',
